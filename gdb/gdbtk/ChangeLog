	* generic/gdbtk-register.c (map_arg_registers): If a specific
	register was requested, just return it without validating it 
	has a name.
	(get_register): Check DEPRECATED_REGISTER_CONVERTIBLE_P ().

	* generic/gdbtk-register.c (Gdbtk_Register_Init): Replace
	calls to register_gdbarch_swap with deprecated_register_gdbarch_swap.

	* library/srcwin.itb: Remove an apparently redundant call 
	to gdbtk_locate_main and location. This actually broke in
	situations where no source files were found.
