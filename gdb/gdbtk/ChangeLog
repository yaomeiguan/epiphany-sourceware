	* library/session.tcl (SESSION_serialize_bps): Ignore
	breakpoints set on internal_error and info_command because
	these are set by .gdbinit and will be recreated by it.
	This is a bit of a hack and should be fixed properly
	someday.
	
	* library/debugwin.itb: Fix incorrect button names
	so they will be enabled/disabled properly.

	* library/srctextwin.itb: Set focus on srcwin only
	if another window doesn't have the focus.

	* library/interface.tcl (set_exe): Allow users to debug
