The empty files in this directory exist so that unmodified
toshapi .cc/.cxx files can #include them without causing
errors.  The declarations that one might find in these
files are already loaded into the compilation unit
../toshapi.cxx from ../toshapi.h.

The files AddSubHWE.h, LmemHWE.h, MulDSP.h, MulUci.h
correspond to the SimAPI_test suite, and are here
temporarily.
