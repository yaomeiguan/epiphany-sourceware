  hw-lcd-t6963c-0101 hw-lcd-t6963c-0201

* Synopsis
  Simulates the Toshiba T6963C LCD controller. The controller supports display
  sizes from 32 to 80 columns and from 2 to 32 lines. The fonts may also be
  varied from 5X8 dots to 8X8 dots. The chip supports an external display RAM
  of up to 64 Kbytes. This RAM may be arbitrarily configured between text and
  graphics, and attributes such as blink and reverse can be specified on a per
  character basis. The chip comes with a 128 character ROM of predefined fonts.
  Two ROMS are available: hw-lcd-t6963c-0101 specifies the European standard 
  font; hw-lcd-t6963c-0201 is the Japanese standard font.

* Functionality
  - Modeling
    The LCD controller model is somewhat abstracted from the physical device:

    o All commands in the model are executed instantaneously, while the real
      device requires significant time to execute a command. As a result, the
      status flag in the model always shows "ready".

    o The real device has a number of shift/latch pins that are used to drive
      the display. These are replaced by 2 pins in the model. The FR (frame) 
      pin is driven to 1 to identify that a new frame is starting, and driven 
      to 0 when the frame is finished. The row-col pin is driven once for each
      "on" pixel in the display, and the value on the pin is the [X,Y] co-
      ordinates of the pixel, encoded as two adjacent 16-bit values in the 
      32-bit pin value.

      With these two pins, a display refresh cycle starts when the FR pin is
      asserted; the [X,Y] co-ordinates of all the "on" pixels are then 
      transmitted on the row-col pin; and the FR pin is de-asserted to end 
      the refresh cycle.

    o The physical device uses an external crystal to set the duty cycle.
      The model uses the refresh-period-msec attribute to communicate with
      the scheduler to set the refresh rate.

      To reduce system overhead, the model tries to reduce its interaction
      with the scheduler and display. Specifically, a single refresh cycle is 
      initiated if there is a write to the component, to capture any internal
      state changes that may affect the display. Because several writes are
      often required to effect a meaningful change, the refresh is delayed to
      occur refresh-period-msec milliseconds after the first write. As well,
      the refresh is continued periodically if blink is enabled.

    o The physical device uses a number of pins to set the display geometry
      (MDS, MD0-3) and font width (FS0-1). The model uses the display-width,
      display-height, and font-width attributes to set these parameters.

    o Screen Peek and Screen Copy are not (currently) supported.

    o Dual-Scan is not (currently) supported.

  - Behaviors
    * Configuration

      refresh-period-msec: used specify the refresh period (in milliseconds)
      for continuous update modes such as blink.

      display-width: specifies the number of columns in pixels. Legal values
      are those that can be represented by the MD2-MD3 pins on the real chip.

      display-height: specifies the number of rows in characters (each 
      each character is 8 pixels high). Legal values correspond to the 
      single-scan (ie. non-DUAL mode) values that can be represented by the 
      MDS, MD0, and MD11 pins on the real chip.

      font-width: specifies the width of each character in pixels.
      Corresponds to the values specifiable by the FS0-1 pins on the real chip.

  - SID conventions
    * This is a functional component
    * Save/restore is supported via the state-snapshot attribute
    * Trigger point support is available on the following registers:
      SR, X-ADRS, Y-ADRS, Offset, ADP, TH, GH, TA, and GA.

* Environment
  - Related components
    * The T6963C requires an external memory for its display RAM. This RAM
      can be any size up to 64KBytes. Besides the memory (and CPU bus), the 
      LCD controller is usually connected to a display of some kind. Clearly,
      the display component must be aware of the refresh protocol used by the 
      T6963C model. Finally, the scheduler is typically used to set up the 
      time between refreshes of the display.

    * The following configuration file segment shows how the LCD controller
      can be connected to 64K external RAM, the tcl based display, and the 
      host-time scheduler:

      new hw-lcd-t6963c-0101 lcd	# Standard European font
      new hw-visual-lcd display		# The display is implemented in Tcl
      new sid-sched-host sched		# Use the real-time scheduler
      
      # scheduling (must appear before pin assignments)
      set sched num-clients 1
      set sched 0-regular? 1
      set sched 0-time 500		# in msec

      # display size is in pixels - ie. font-width*display-height
      set display width 160		# 20 chars X 8 pixels per char
      set display height 48		# 6 lines of 8 pixels per line

      # lcd geometry values must match allowed pin settings
      set lcd display-width 32		# 32 chars (closest to 20)
      set lcd display-height 6		# 6 rows/lines

      # connect the LCD to the scheduler
      connect-pin sched 0-event -> lcd refresh-sync-event
      connect-pin sched 0-control <- lcd refresh-sync-control
      # connect the LCD to the display
      connect-pin lcd row-col -> display row-col
      connect-pin lcd FR -> display FR

      # connect external display ram
      new hw-memory-ram/rom-basic d-ram
      set d-ram size 65535
      connect-bus lcd external-ram d-ram read-write-port
