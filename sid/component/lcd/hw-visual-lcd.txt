* Name
  hw-visual-lcd

* Synopsis
  Simulates a dot matrix LCD display, using Tcl/Tk to manage the graphics 
  window

  Pins: row-col FR
  Attributes: width height bits-per-pixel background-color

  Library: none
  Symbol name: hw-visual-display

* Functionality
  - Modeling
    The LCD display model is somewhat abstracted from the physical device:

    o A real display typically has separate row and column pins that are cycled
      to select each pixel in the display. These are replaced by 2 pins
      in the model. The FR (frame) pin is driven to 1 to identify that a new
      frame is starting, and driven to 0 when the frame is finished. The
      row-col pin incorporates all of the functionality of the row and column
      drivers on the real chip. This pin is driven once for each "on" pixel
      in the display.  The value on the pin is the [X,Y] co-ordinates of
      the pixel, encoded as two adjacent 16-bit values in the 32-bit pin value.

      The two pins are used to initiate and terminate a display refresh cycle.
      A display refresh cycle starts when the FR pin is asserted; the [X,Y] 
      co-ordinates of all the "on" pixels are then transmitted on the row-col 
      pin; and the FR pin is de-asserted to end the refresh cycle.

    o The physical device must be refreshed periodically, but the model retains
      its last written values indefinitely.

  - Behaviors
    o Configuration
      The window geometry is specified in SCREEN pixels via the width and
      depth attributes. Each pixel in the simulated display occupies a box of
      bits-per-pixel by bits-per-pixel screen pixels. Bits-per-pixel is also
      a settable attribute, and defaults to a 4X4 box. Thus, the number of
      simulated rows is depth/bits-per-pixel; and the number of simulated
      columns is width/bits-per-pixel.

      While "on" pixels are currently always drawn as black, the background
      color of the simulated display can be specified using the standard Tcl/Tk
      color specification syntax (eg. #6fa700 or white). This color is 
      specified with the background-color attribute.

    o Display
      See discussion of the FR and row-col pins in Modeling section above

* Environment
  - Related components
    * The LCD display is typically connected to a controller via the tk-bridge.
      The following configuration file segment shows how the HD44780U LCD 
      controller can be connected to the hw-visual-lcd display:

      new hw-lcd-hd44780u-a00 lcd	# Standard Japanese font
      new hw-visual-lcd display		# instantiate the display
      
      # display size is in pixels - ie. font-width*display-height
      set display width 40		# 8 chars X 5 pixels per char
      set display height 8		# single line of 8 pixels

      # connect the LCD to the display
      connect-pin lcd row-col -> display row-col
      connect-pin lcd FR -> display FR
