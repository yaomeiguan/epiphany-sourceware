* Name
  hw-lcd-char-display

* Synopsis
  Simulates a dot matrix LCD display, using curses (a cursor control library) 
  to manage the graphics inside a text window.

  Pins: row-col FR init
  Attributes: width height 

  Library: liblcd-char-display.la
  Symbol name: lcd_char_display_component_library

* Functionality
  - Modelling
    The LCD display model is somewhat abstracted from the physical device:

    o A real display typically has separate row and column pins that are cycled
      to select each pixel in the display. These are replaced by 2 pins
      in the model. The FR (frame) pin is driven to 1 to identify that a new
      frame is starting, and driven to 0 when the frame is finished. The
      row-col pin incorporates all the functionality of the row and column
      drivers on the real chip. This pin is driven once for each "on" pixel
      in the display, and the value on the pin is the [X,Y] co-ordinates of
      the pixel, encoded as two adjacent 16-bit values in the 32-bit pin value.

      With these two pins, a display refresh cycle starts when the FR pin is
      asserted; the [X,Y] co-ordinates of all the "on" pixels are then 
      transmitted on the row-col pin; and the FR pin is de-asserted to end 
      the refresh cycle.

    o The physical device must be refreshed periodically, but the model retains
      its last written values indefinitely.

  - Behaviors
    * Configuration
      The width and height attributes set the display size in units of
      characters. For example, the default values are 80 and 24 for width
      and height, respectively. This is the size of a standard CRT window.

    * Display
      See discussion of the FR and row-dol pins in Modeling section above.

  - SID conventions
    * This is a functional component.
    * Save/restore is supported.
    * Triggerpoint support is available on all three input pins.

* Environment
  - Related components
    * The LCD display is typically connected to an LCD controller.
      The following configuration file segment shows how the HD44780U LCD 
      controller can be connected to the display:

      new hw-lcd-hd44780u-a00 lcd	# Standard Japanese font
      new hw-lcd-char-display display
      
      # display size is in pixels - ie. font-width*display-height
      set display width 40		# 8 chars X 5 pixels per char
      set display height 8		# single line of 8 pixels

      # connect the LCD to the display
      connect-pin lcd row-col -> display row-col
      connect-pin lcd FR -> display FR
