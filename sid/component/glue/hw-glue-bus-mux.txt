* Name
  hw-glue-bus-mux

* Synopsis
  This component provides switchable access from one bus to two separate
  accessors.

  Buses: upstream
  Accessors: downstream1, downstream2
  Attributes: switch
  Pins: switch
  Shared library: libglue.la
  Symbol: glue_component_library

* Functionality
 
  - Modelling
    * This component is a bus multiplexer with one input bus, two
      output accessors, and a switch to alternate between them.

  - Behaviors
    * Initialization
      At start-up, the single input bus: "upstream" is tied by default
      to "downstream1".

    * Switching
      When the "switch" pin is driven high, the output accessor will
      be switched from the current output accessor to the one not in use.
      The "switch" pin can be driven any number of times, each time
      causing the output to be switched.

    * Bus traffic
      Input to the "upstream" bus is passed on to the current
      output accessor: either "downstream1" or "downstream2".

  - SID conventions
    * This is a functional component.
    * It presents one attribute in the "pin" category.

* Environment
  - Related components
    * This component may be used as to implement a multiplexer by
      combining two bus-mux components with the same accessors in the
      opposite order.  For example:

	new hw-glue-bus-mux bus-mux1
	new hw-glue-bus-mux bus-mux2
        connect-bus cpu data-memory-x bus-mux1 upstream
        connect-bus coprocessor data-memory-x bus-mux2 upstream
        connect-bus bus-mux1 downstream1 data-memory-x1 read-write-port
        connect-bus bus-mux1 downstream2 data-memory-x2 read-write-port
        connect-bus bus-mux2 downstream1 data-memory-x2 read-write-port
        connect-bus bus-mux2 downstream2 data-memory-x1 read-write-port
	connect-pin cpu memory-x-ctl bus-mux1 switch
        connect-pin cpu memory-x-ctl bus-mux2 switch
