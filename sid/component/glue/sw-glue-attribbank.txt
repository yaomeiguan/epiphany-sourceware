* Name
  sw-glue-attribbank

* Synopsis
  This component stores an arbitrary collection of attribute name/value pairs.

  Attributes: *
  Shared library: libglue.la
  Symbol: glue_component_library

* Functionality
 
  - Modelling
    * It stores copies of all incoming attribute values indefinitely.

  - Behaviors
    * Attribute storage
      This component accepts all data values.  It returns copies verbatim.
      Any unknown attribute name, when read, returns the empty string.

  - SID conventions
    * This is a functional component.
    * It does not support state save/restore, since even the
      "state-snapshot" attribute is not assigned any special semantics. 

* Environment
  - Related components
    * This component may be used in unit tests as a passive model of
      another component.  This is especially useful if the other component 
      is complicated to configure and to use in a testing environment, 
      and if its attributes only are of interest.
  - Host system
    * If many attribute names or lengthy attribute values are stored,
      this component may use much host memory. 

* SID interface reference
  - low level:
    * attributes
      - any | no category | any | n/a | attribute storage
