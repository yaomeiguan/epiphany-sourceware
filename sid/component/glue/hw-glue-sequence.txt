* Name
  hw-glue-sequence hw-glue-sequence-1 hw-glue-sequence-2 hw-glue-sequence-8

* Synopsis
  This component family distributes pin signals from a source to a sequence 
  of sinks.

  Attributes: num-outputs state-snapshot input
  Pins: input output-NNN
  Shared library: libglue.la
  Symbol: glue_component_library

* Functionality
 
  - Modelling
    * This component resembles a fan-out net in a circuit, or a very fast
      shift register.
    * The number of outputs is a matter of configuration.  For the "-1", "-2",
      and "-8" family members, the num-outputs is initialized. 

  - Behaviors
    * Configuration
      When the "num-outputs" is written-to, this
      component adjusts its list of output pins, named "output-0",
      "output-1", and so on.  New ones may be generated or old ones may
      disappear.

    * Data forwarding
      Each input signal on the "input" pin is forwarded to
      all external pins connected to the "output-0" pin, then
      "output-1", and so on, in sequence, for all configured outputs.

  - SID conventions
    * This is a functional component.
    * It supports state save/restore, though state is minimal (the number 
      of outputs).
    * It supports triggerpoints by watching the input pin and the 
     "num-outputs" attribute.
    * It limits recursion on the "input" pin.
    * It presents attributes in the "pin", "setting", and "watchable" categories.

* Environment
  - Related components
    * This component may be used as an initialization sequencer in a
      scenario with ordering dependencies.  See this configuration fragment:

	new hw-glue-sequence reset-manager
	new SOME_KIND_OF_CPU cpu
	new SOME_KIND_OF_LOADER loader
	set reset-manager num-outputs 3
	connect-pin reset-manager input <- main running
	connect-pin reset-manager output-0 -> cpu reset
	connect-pin reset-manager output-1 -> loader load!

    * It could be used as a central point to distribute a many-to-many
      broadcast signal.
