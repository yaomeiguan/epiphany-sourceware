This is the sid x86 component.  It is based heavily on code from bochs
1.2.1. I have tried to "wrap" the bochs code as much as possible so
that new bochs releases can be easily incorporated. The design looks
something like this:

+---------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                         |
|  x86_cpu object (cpu/sid-x86-cpu-wrapper.h)             |<---+
|                                                         |<-+ |
|     +-------------------------------------------------+ |  | |
|     | bx_cpu_c object (cpu/cpu.h)                     | |  | |
|     |                                                 | |  | |
|     |    x86_cpu * ----------------------------------------+ |
|     |                                                 | |    |
|     +-------------------------------------------------+ |    |
|     +-------------------------------------------------+ |    |
|     | sid_mem_c object (cpu/memory/sid-bochs-memory.h)| |    |
|     |                                                 | |    |
|     |    x86_cpu * ------------------------------------------+
|     |                                                 | |
|     +-------------------------------------------------+ |
+---------------------------------------------------------+

The sid_cpu_c class inherits from bx_cpu_c which is the main bochs cpu
class. Likewise, sid_mem_c inherits from bx_mem_c, the main bochs
memory class. Anytime a bochs member function needed to be changed to
work in the sid framework, I overrode the function in either sid_cpu_c
or sid_mem_c.
