  <func>
    <modelling>
      <p>
      This component encapsulates the configuration file parser
      and the simulation main loop.  It does not correspond to
      hardware.</p>

      <title>
      configuration file format</title>

      <p>The configuration file format is very simple, and the
      parser/lexer are minimal.  Each command in the configuration
      file maps to 1-3 <tt>sid::component</tt> API calls.  There is no
      application- or component-dependent logic.</p>


      <title>Grammar:</title>

      <code>cfg-file ::= cfg-line | cfg-file cfg-line</code>

      <code>cfg-line ::=
  load-cmd | new-cmd | connect-pin-cmd | disconnect-pin-cmd |
  connect-bus-cmd | disconnect-bus-cmd | set-cmd | relate-cmd | unrelate-cmd
      </code>

      <code>load-cmd ::= "load" file-name symbol-name
file-name ::= string
symbol-name ::= string
      </code>

      <p>Register a component library.  Load the shared library from
      the file named by the first string, or fall back to the sid
      mainline executable itself.  Look up a component_library symbol
      named by the second string.  Add all component type names to the
      catalog of types.  Its
      <tt>sid::component_library::list_component_types</tt> hook is
      called.  A compatibility magic value in the component library is
      tested.  If a filename omits a directory specification, then the
      installed location and a search path held in the
      <tt>SID_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> environment variable is searched for
      the library.  The library directory under that given by
      <tt>SID_EXEC_PREFIX</tt> environment variable (optionally set at
      sid installation time), or else the build-time
      <tt>--exec-prefix</tt>, is also searched.</p>

      <code>new-cmd ::= "new" type-name comp-name
type-name ::= string
comp-name ::= string
      </code>

      <p>Instantiate a new component.  The first string is the
      component type, as registered in a prior load-cmd.  The second
      string is the new component instance's nick-name.  The nicknames
      must be unique among those built by cfgroot.  The lucky winner's
      <tt>sid::component_library::create_component</tt> hook is
      called.</p>

      <code>connect-pin-cmd ::= "connect-pin" comp-name pin-name dir comp-name pin-name
dir ::= "-&gt;" | "&lt;-" | "&lt;-&gt;"
comp-name ::= string
pin-name ::= string
      </code>

      <p> Establish a new pin-to-pin connection between two
      components.  The component/pin to the left of the <tt>-&gt;</tt> or right
      of the <tt>&lt;-</tt> operator receives
      a<tt>sid::component::connect_pin</tt> call.  The other receives
	a <tt>sid::component::find_pin</tt> call.  If the <tt>&lt;-&gt;</tt>
      operator is specified, then establish two pin-to-pin links in
      opposite directions.</p>

      <code>
disconnect-pin-cmd ::= "disconnect-pin" comp-name pin-name dir comp-name pin-name
dir ::= "-&gt;" | "&lt;-" | "&lt;-&gt;"
comp-name ::= string
pin-name ::= string
</code>

      <p> Break an existing pin-to-pin connection between two
      components.  The component/pin to the left of the <tt>-&gt;</tt>
      or right of the <tt>&lt;-</tt> operator receives a
      <tt>sid::component::disconnect_pin</tt> call.  The other
      receives a <tt>sid::component::find_pin</tt> call.  If the
      <tt>&lt;-&gt;</tt> operator is specified, then the connection
      will be broken in both directions.</p>

      <code>connect-bus-cmd ::= "connect-bus" comp-name acc-name comp-name bus-name
comp-name ::= string
acc-name ::= string
bus-name ::= string
</code>

      <p>Establish a new accessor-to-bus connection between two
      components.  The left component receives a
      <tt>sid::component::connect_accessor</tt> call; the right
      component receives a <tt>sid::component::find_bus</tt> call.</p>

      <code>disconnect-bus-cmd ::= "disconnect-bus" comp-name acc-name comp-name bus-name
comp-name ::= string
acc-name ::= string
bus-name ::= string
</code>
      <p>Break an existing accessor-to-bus connection between two
      components.  The left component recevies a
      <tt>sid::component::disconnect_accessor</tt> call; the right
      component receives a <tt>sid::component::find_bus</tt> call.</p>

      <code>set-cmd ::= "set" comp-name attr-name attr-value
comp-name ::= string
attr-name ::= string
attr-value ::= string
</code>

      <p>Set the given attribute of the given component to the given
      value.  The component receives a
      <tt>sid::component::set_attribute_value</tt> call.</p>

      <code>relate-cmd ::= "relate" comp-name rel-name comp-name
comp-name ::= string
rel-name ::= string
</code>

      <p>Add the second named component to the named component
      relationship set for the first given component.  The first
      component receives a <tt>sid::component::relate</tt> call.</p>

      <code>unrelate-cmd ::= "unrelate" comp-name rel-name comp-name
comp-name ::= string
rel-name ::= string
</code>

      <p>Remove the second named component from the named component
      relationship set for the first given component.  The first
      component receives a <tt>sid::component::unrelate</tt> call.</p>


      <title>Lexer issues:</title>

      <p>A string is a white-space-separated sequence of printable (
      <tt>isprint()</tt>) characters.  If started with double-quotes,
      all characters between opening and closing quotes are included
      in the string.  Embedded lexer control characters ('<tt>\</tt>'
      and '<tt>"</tt>') may be escaped by a '<tt>\</tt>' prefix.
      "<tt>\n</tt>" is interpreted as a C++ <tt>\n</tt>.  (What other
      escape sequences are worth supporting?)</p>

      <p>A "<tt>#</tt>" character found where a string is expected is
      interpreted as a comment to end-of-line, and the search for the
      next string found is returned instead.</p>



    </modelling>

    <behavior name="configuration">

      <p>
      When the 
	<attribute>config-file!</attribute> attribute is written to, the value is
      interpreted as a file name, and processed as a configuration
      file.  The name of the file is appended to a history list,
      which is accessible as the read-only attribute 
	<attribute>config-file-history</attribute>.</p>

      <p>
      The format of the configuration file is described in the
      APPENDIX below.  As each line is read, the appropriate component
      API functions are called.  In case of any failure, a message is
      printed to standard error, and a failure result code will be
      returned from the <tt>set_attribute_value</tt> call.</p>

      <p>
      If the <attribute>auto-print?</attribute> attribute is set to a
      true value, then as each component instance is created, all its
      attributes in the <tt>auto-print</tt> category will be queried
      and printed to standard output.</p>

      <p>
      The effects of multiple writes to the
      <attribute>config-file!</attribute> attribute are cumulative.
      The <tt>sid-control-cfgroot</tt> component is always implicitly
      present with the component name <tt>main</tt>.  If the
      <attribute>verbose?</attribute> attribute is set, some tracing
      messages are printed during configuration.</p>

      <p>
      When the <attribute>config-line!</attribute> attribute is
      written to, the supplied value is interpreted as a single
      configuration command and executed, as if that value was written
      to a file, and the file's name supplied to the
      <attribute>config-file!</attribute> attribute.</p>

    </behavior>

    <behavior name="startup">

      <p>
      When the <pin>run!</pin> pin is driven, the simulation top level
      loop begins. This process has several stages.  </p>

      <p>
      First, all components registered in the
	<relationship>component-catalog-informees</relationship> relationship are given the
      then-current list of components.  This is done by setting a
      number of individual component relationships for every informee.
      Each relationship contains a single instantiated component
      pointer, and has the name constructed as "TYPE NAME", as
      appropriate for that component.</p>

      <p>
      Immediately after this, the simulation main loop behavior takes
      over.  Only after that main loop is finished will control return
      to the function that sent the <pin>run!</pin> signal to this
      component.</p>

    </behavior>

    <behavior name="main loop">
      The main loop has two levels.  An infinite outer loop remains
      active as long as the
      <attribute>persistent?</attribute> attribute is set to a
      boolean
      <tt>true</tt> value.  

      The body of this loop performs a sequence of steps.  First, it
      drives the <pin>starting</pin> output pin.  Then, it enters the
      inner main loop.  At the start of this loop, the
      <attribute>running</attribute> attribute is set to boolean
      <tt>true</tt>.  In the loop, the
      <attribute>activity-count</attribute> attribute is incremented,
      and the <pin> perform-activity</pin> output pin is repeatedly
      driven.  This loop runs until the <pin>stop!</pin> input pin is
      driven.  (This could happen during the initial
      <pin>starting</pin> signal, in which case this inner loop will
      not be entered at all.)  The value driven on the <pin>stop!</pin>
      is stored in the <attribute>stop-code</attribute> attribute.
      After the inner loop exits, the <pin>stopping</pin> output pin is driven.
