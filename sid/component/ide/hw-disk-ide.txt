* Functionality
  - Modelling
    * This component models a PC-style ATA (IDE) hard drive controller
      plus up to two disk drives.  The two individually configured drives
      use host files for storage of the disk image.  Access time
      appears to be instantaneous to the simulated target.

    * This model supports only old IDE programming interfaces.  These
      should be a common subset of most real IDE-like devices (hard
      drives, CD-ROMs, CompactFlash drives, etc.).  Only PIO
      (programmed I/O) is supported, so no ATAPI or DMA functions are
      available.  However, the drive models are self-describing, so
      they can indicate that these missing functions are not
      available.

  - Behaviors
    * Initialization
      All parameters must be set for the selected simulated drive (N=0
      or 1) to become available.  The given disk image file will be
      opened for read and write as long as the "driveN-file" attribute
      is set.  Undefined behaviour occurs if these settings are
      changed while the drive model is in use, or if the values are
      illegal.  Undefined behaviour occurs if the same disk image file
      is shared by more than one simulated drive.

    * Register access

      Several standard IDE registers may be accessed across the
      "control-block-bus" and "command-block-bus", and also via
      watchable attributes.

      The "data port" register lives at address 0 in the
      command-block-bus.  As a quirk of the IDE interface standard,
      either an 8- or 16-bit access to address 0 on this bus will
      access this register.

    * Command execution
      To control IDE devices, you set the registers that specify the 
      location of an intended transfer, then write a command byte into 
      the command register.  An IDE interface standard provides for
      synchronization between a processor and the IDE controller.  The DRQ, 
      DRDY, and ERROR bits in the status register are emulated for this.

    * Command execution: read/write
      IDE commands 0x20, 0x21, 0x30, 0x31 are supported.  Multiple-sector 
      transfers are supported and involve DRQ/interrupt synchronization.  
      LBA and CHS addressing are both supported.

    * Command execution: identify
      IDE command 0xEC is supported.  It arranges to copy data into or out of 
      the selected drive's sector buffers

    * Command execution: stub commands
      IDE commands 0x10-0x1F (RECALIBRATE) and 0x70-0x7F (SEEK) are simulated
      by instantaneous stubs.

    * Command execution: unknown commands
      An attempt to execute illegal commands, or commands on nonexistent drives,
      results in an ERROR bit in the status register, and an interrupt.

  - SID conventions
    * This is a functional component.

    * It supports state save/restore for controller state (including
      registers and sector buffers).  It does not include a snapshot
      of the disk images, however.

    * It supports triggerpoints for most control registers.

* Environment
  - Related components
    * The IDE model is a self-contained slave peripheral.  It does not
      need to be coupled with other specific components to operate.

    * To use an IDE model in a system simulation, you must map its
      two buses into an address space, connect its interrupt line 
      (if needed), and configure its drives.  The following
      configuration file fragment shows how:

	# Add the IDE drive model library
	load libide.la ide_component_library
	# Instantiate component
	new hw-disk-ide ide0
	# ... assume memory mapper named "mapper"
	# ... assume PC standard IDE channel 0 addresses
	connect-bus mapper [0x3F0-0x3F7] ide0 control-block-bus
	connect-bus mapper [0x1F0-0x1F7] ide0 command-block-bus
	# ... assume some fictional interrupt controller
	connect-pin ide0 interrupt -> fic irq14
	#
	# (For PC standard IDE channel 1,
	#  use base addresses 0x370 and 0x170,
	#  and irq15 respectively.)
	#
	# ... configure drive 0 (master): 128*10*32 sectors = 20 MB capacity
	set ide0 drive0-present? 1
	set ide0 drive0-file "/tmp/drive-0-image"
	set ide0 drive0-num-cylinders 128
	set ide0 drive0-num-heads 10
	set ide0 drive0-num-sectors-per-track 32

  - Host system
    * The IDE drive model relies on up to two external files for
      storage of the virtual disk images.  These files may be accessed
      in a sparse way by the target program, so the resulting files
      may have "holes".  Configuring a virtual drive that is larger
      than 2 GB is not supported.  The various "driveN-num-*"
      parameters are multiplied together to arrive at the number of
      512-byte sectors to model.

    * Some error conditions are signalled by messages to cerr.  These
      include some host I/O errors, and some simulated violations of
      IDE command synchronization.
