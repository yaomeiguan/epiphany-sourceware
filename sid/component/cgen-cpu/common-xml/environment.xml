    <p>CPUs connect to many components: memory to store data and
    instructions, a scheduler to provide <pin>step!</pin> signals, software
    trap emulators, debugger interfaces.  The <pin>step-cycles</pin> output pin
    may be used as a N-event-control input for a target scheduler to
    track an estimate of consumed target time.</p>
