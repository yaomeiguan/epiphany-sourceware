* Name
  hw-rtc-sid

* Synopsis
  This component is a fictional simplified high-precision real time clock.

  Buses: registers
  Attributes: hour minute second "tk xclock clone"
  Library: librtc.la
  Symbol name: rtc_component_library

* Functionality

  - Modelling
    * This component is similar to high-precision dedicated counters
      present as performance tuning aids in some microprocessors.  It
      supplies snapshots of the host systems' time to a target application.

  - Behaviors
    * Timing

      Whenever this component's bus is read with a valid address, it
      returns the addressed subset of two words of information.  The
      first word (address 0x0) contains the number of seconds since the
      host system's epoch.  The second word (address 0x4) contains the
      number of nanoseconds within that second.  Both words are supplied
      in big-endian order.

    * More timing

      As a special bonus, the "hour", "minute", and "second"
      attributes contain the appropriate numbers for the current
      moment, in the GMT timezone.
  
  - SID conventions

    * This is a functional component.
    * It has no state to save, and has no use for triggerpoints.
    * It supports component GUIs.

* Environment

  - Related components
    * To use this component, map it into 8 bytes of address
      space, as in the following sample configuration file fragment: 

	new hw-rtc-sid rtc
        connect-bus mapper [0x1000,0x1007] rtc registers

    * The "hw-visual-clock" component is a candidate gui for this
      component.

        new hw-rtc-sid rtc
        new hw-visual-clock rtc-gui
	relate rtc-gui "your rtc friend" rtc

  - Host system
    * The component relies on the accuracy and precision of UTC time
      maintained by the host.

* SID interface reference
  - low level:
    * buses
      - registers | 0x0 - 0x7 | read | timing
    * attributes
      - hour | register | 0..23 | n/a | more timing
      - minute | register | 0..59 | n/a | more timing
      - second | register | 0..59 | n/a | more timing
