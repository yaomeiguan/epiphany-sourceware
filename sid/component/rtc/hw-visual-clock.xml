  <synop>
  This is a graphical component for displaying the time given by a
  related real-time clock, such as the <complib>hw-rtc-ds1x42</complib>.
  </synop>
  <func>
    <modelling>
      <p>This component uses a graphical clock face to represent the
      time stored by a real-time clock.  This component will
      inter-operate with many kinds of real time clocks, provided they
      provide <attribute>hour</attribute>,
      <attribute>minute</attribute> and <attribute>second</attribute>
      attributes.</p>
    </modelling>

    <behavior name="window layout">
      <p>The component supports resizing of its window.  Its geometry
      may also be specified by another component, in which case the
      window will be resized accordingly.  The minimum geometry is
      150x150 and the aspect ratio must be 1 to 1 (that is, the window
      must remain square, so that the clock face is circular).</p>

      <p>The component also allows you to alter the window title via
      the <attribute>title</attribute> attribute.  By default, the
      window will be titled by the name of the relation through which
      the target component was configured.</p>
      </behavior>

    <behavior name="time display">
      <p>When a related real-time clock component is specified, this
      component will periodically query that component's
      <attribute>hour</attribute>, <attribute>minute</attribute> and
      <attribute>second</attribute> attributes to obtain values for
      the clock's known time.  This will be shown on the graphical
      display.  If no related component is specified, the clock face
      will be cleared.</p>
    </behavior>

    <convention name="supervisory" supported="true">
      This is a supervisory gui component.

  <env>
    <title>Related components</title>

    <p>To use this component, relate it to a real-time clock component
    instance that provides the necessary <attribute>hour</attribute>,
    <attribute>minute</attribute> and <attribute>second</attribute>
    attributes:</p>

    <code>
        new hw-rtc-ds1642 rtc
	[...]
        new hw-visual-clock clock-display
	relate clock-display "rtc window" rtc

    </code>

    <p>Because this component is written in Tk, the bridge-tk event
      handling pins must be connected for at least one Tcl/Tk/BLT
      component.</p>
