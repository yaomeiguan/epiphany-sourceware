           hw-mapper-basic (libmapper.la :: mapper_component_library)

Synopsis:

   This component is a generalized model of the distributed computer
   circuitry that decodes bus addresses.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Functionality:

  Modelling:

   This component distributes bus accesses to one of a number of configured
   bus accessors, depending on the address of the incoming memory access.

   A mapper defines an address space. The address space is decomposed into
   non-overlapping regions by configuring a dynamic collection of accessors.
   Each accessor is connected to a single slave bus. To configure the address
   mapping, you must name each accessor according to one of these forms:
     * [<low>-<high>]
     * [<low>-<high>,<wordsize>]
     * [<low>-<high>,<stride>,<width>]
     * [<low>-<high>,<stride>,<width>,<wordsize>]
   where:
     * <low> is the starting address for the mapped region.
     * <high> is the ending address for the mapped region.
     * <stride> is the step size between addressable units.
     * <width> is the width of addressable units.
     * <wordsize> is the number of bytes in an address unit: a constant
       multiplier you can use to permit specifying <low>, <high>, <stride>
       and <width> in terms of multi-byte words.

   In addition, any text may appear outside the "[" and "]" brackets, as long
   as that text does not include any of the separator characters "[" "]" "-"
   ",".

   Each number may be specified in decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and binary
   forms, with the appropriate prefix (none, "0x", "0", "0b", respectively).

   The first form is appropriate if the slave device is willing to accept all
   possible sid::bus accesses (subject to the address range limits). The
   second form is appropriate if the slave device is willing to accept only
   accesses to addressable units of fixed width at a fixed stride from one
   another.

   See the "mapping" behavior below for more details.

   |-------------------------------------------------|
   |  configuration | When an accessor of the        |
   |                | prescribed format is set, and  |
   |                | the address range is valid,    |
   |                | the supplied bus is registered |
   |                | in the decoding table. Future  |
   |                | accesses on the access-port    |
   |                | bus will consider that address |
   |                | range as a candidate.          |
   |                |                                |
   |                | Reasons for rejecting an       |
   |                | address range include          |
   |                | overlapping with an existing   |
   |                | entry, or inconsistent ranges  |
   |                | or stride/width values.        |
   |----------------+--------------------------------|
   |        mapping | When an incoming access on the |
   |                | access-port bus is received,   |
   |                | its base address is compared   |
   |                | to all the registered outgoing |
   |                | accessors. If one is found     |
   |                | that contains the address, the |
   |                | current address is transformed |
   |                | according to the following     |
   |                | rules:                         |
   |                |   * The accessor's <low>       |
   |                |     address is subtracted from |
   |                |     the incoming address, so   |
   |                |     outgoing addresses will be |
   |                |     relative and zero-based.   |
   |                |   * If the accessor has        |
   |                |     stride/width values,       |
   |                |     divide the relative        |
   |                |     address by the quotient    |
   |                |     (<stride>/<width>). As a   |
   |                |     result, outgoing addresses |
   |                |     will refer to consecutive  |
   |                |     addressable units, and an  |
   |                |     outgoing access of the     |
   |                |     desired width will be      |
   |                |     made.                      |
   |                |   * If the accessor has no     |
   |                |     stride/width values, the   |
   |                |     relative address and the   |
   |                |     incoming access width will |
   |                |     be used to make an         |
   |                |     outgoing access.           |
   |                |                                |
   |                | This component will return an  |
   |                | incoming access prematurely    |
   |                | with sid::bus::unmapped if no  |
   |                | accessor covers the incoming   |
   |                | address. Similarly, it will    |
   |                | signal a sid::bus::misaligned  |
   |                | condition if an incoming       |
   |                | access could be handled by a   |
   |                | stride/width accessor, but the |
   |                | addressed bytes don't cover    |
   |                | exactly one addressable unit.  |
   |                |                                |
   |                | Whenever an incoming access is |
   |                | attempted, the component       |
   |                | increments its access-count    |
   |                | attribute. When a repeated     |
   |                | access hits an internal        |
   |                | mapping cache, the             |
   |                | cache-hit-count is             |
   |                | incremented. Whenever an       |
   |                | incoming address is contained  |
   |                | in a specific accessor's       |
   |                | address interval, the          |
   |                | ACCESSOR-count attribute is    |
   |                | incremented. (The ACCESSOR     |
   |                | string is the name of the      |
   |                | accessor.)                     |
   |----------------+--------------------------------|
   | memory latency | This component models constant |
   |                | latency for accesses which     |
   |                | pass through the mapper. The   |
   |                | value of the latency is added  |
   |                | to the total latency of every  |
   |                | bus transaction. The units of  |
   |                | latency are nominal, but       |
   |                | typically represent a number   |
   |                | of system clock cycles.        |

   Related components

   Commonly, this component will be placed between a CPU and an array of bus
   peripherals. The hw-glue-probe-bus component may be used in conjunction
   with this component to analyze and troubleshoot bus configuration
   problems, being chained to either the CPU side of the mapper or the
   peripherals side.

   An illustration of a simple configuration for an ARM7T system with a main
   memory and a memory mapped UART follows:

         new hw-cpu-arm7t cpu
         new hw-mapper-basic bus
         new hw-uart-ns16550
         new hw-memory-ram/rom-basic mem
         set mem size 4194304
         connect-bus cpu insn-memory bus access-port
         connect-bus cpu data-memory bus access-port
         connect-bus bus [0xD800000,0xD80001F,4,1] uart Bus
         connect-bus bus [0x0,0x400000] mem read-write-port

   Here, the CPU's accessors are connected directly to the mapper. All
   peripherals are connected downstream from the mapper. They will have their
   bus transactions routed to them by the mapper, by virtue of configuration.
