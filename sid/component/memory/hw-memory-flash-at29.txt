* Synopsis
  This is a simulated ATMEL AT29 series flash memory.  It can be configured
  to emulate any of the AT29 family members.

  Buses: read-write-port
  Pins: image-load image-store
  Attributes: device-code image-file manufacturer-code sector-size size size-max

  Library: libmemory.la
  Symbol name: mem_component_library  

* Functionality

  - Modelling

    * In the actual hardware, the ATMEL flash memory has timing
      sensitivities when programming sectors.  During such programming, 
      the final byte that is modified in a sector is set to an
      incorrect value until the programming has been completed.  In
      simulation, the programming of a sector appears to be
      instantaneous.  Therefore, it may not be possible to detect
      software programs that are not sensitive to the timing
      requirements in real hardware.  

    * The data security facility that prevents the memory
      from being inadvertently modified in the presence of bus
      transients, has a similar restriction that forces data writes to
      be performed in rapid succession.  If an interval elapses, data
      security is re-enabled and the unlocking code sequence must be
      reissued (see ``References'' for more details).

  - Behaviors

    * Configuration

      Flash memory chips are self-describing using their device-code
      and manufacturer-code values, accessible both to a target
      program, and to the simulator user via attributes.  Since a
      target program may infer memory size from these values, further
      simulation configuration that overrides these values should be
      avoided unless necessary.

      The "device-code" attribute represents the device code of the
      flash memory part being simulated.  Refer to the ATMEL data sheet
      for a complete list of device identification codes.  The
      "manufacturer-code" read-only attribute represents the
      manufacturer code of the flash memory.  It is a constant value
      for ATMEL.  The "sector-size" attribute specifies the size of an
      individual sector in the flash memory.  Typical values are 64
      to 512 bytes.

      When the "size" attribute is written-to with a legal value, a
      new cleared byte array is allocated with the new size.  The old
      byte array is thrown away.  The "size-max" read-only attribute
      supplies to the user the maximum size that this component will
      attempt to allocate.

    * Image save/load

      When the "image-load" pin is driven, this component will open
      and attempt to load the contents of the file given by the
      "image-file" attribute into the memory image.  The file is
      copied byte-for-byte.  If the file is too short, zeroes are used
      to fill out the rest of the memory.
 
      Similarly, when the "image-store" pin is driven, the component
      will write to the "image-file" file a byte-for-byte dump of the
      entire memory image.

    * Reading/writing

      When an access is received on the "read-write-port" bus, the
      component checks the incoming address and rejects it if
      out-of-range. The component also rejects non-byte-sized accesses.

      Memory can be read at will, but the data security protocol must
      be followed when writing to the memory - see ATMEL
      documentation.

  - SID conventions
    
    * This is a functional component.
    * The component supports saving and restoring state in addition to
      memory persistence, via the image-store pin/attribute.
    * Triggerpoints are not supported.

* Environment

  - Related components

    * Customized versions of this component are available for standard
      members of the AT29 flash family.  Instantiating each of them is
      equivalent to instantiating this generic component and setting 
      the appropriate "sector-size", "size", and "device-code" attribute
      settings.

    * A flash memory will usually form a small part of the complete
      memory subsystem, providing a region of non-volatile memory. The 
      following configuration file fragment demonstrates this:

	new hw-mapper-basic bus
	new hw-memory-flash-at29lv040 flash # AT29LV040: 512KB size, 512 sector-size
	connect-bus bus [0,0x7FFFF] flash read-write-port

  - Host system

  * The memory is modelled as a contiguous array of bytes in host
    memory.  As such, a component configured for 8MB of memory
    requires 8MB of host memory.  This is an important consideration
    for simulations running on machines with low memory or on busy
    multiuser systems.  Similarly, when a memory image is written to
    disk, the same amount of space may be used there.
