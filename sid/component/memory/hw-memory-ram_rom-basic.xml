  <synop>
  This is a general-purpose byte-addressable RAM or ROM.  Its contents
  may be primed with existing data from a file.  The size of the
  memory may be altered at any time.
  </synop>

  <func>
    <modelling>
      <p>
      This component does not model any particular hardware component.
      It models a generic memory without any access delays.
      </p>
    </modelling>

    <behavior name="configuration">
      <p>
      When the <attribute>size</attribute> attribute is written-to
      with a legal value, a new cleared byte array is allocated with
      the new size.  The old byte array is thrown away.  The
      <attribute>size-max</attribute> read-only attribute supplies to
      the user the maximum size that this component will attempt to
      allocate.  (Larger memory banks may be modelled by using
      multiple instances of this component.)
      </p>
    </behavior>

    <behavior name="image save/load">
      <p>
      When the <pin>image-load</pin> pin is driven, this component
      will open and attempt to load the contents of the file given by
      the <attribute>image-file</attribute> attribute into the memory
      image.  The file is copied byte-for-byte.  If the file is too
      short, zeroes are used to fill out the rest of the memory.  </p>

      <p>
      Similarly, when the <pin>image-store</pin> pin is driven, the
      component will write to the <pin>image-file</pin> file a
      byte-for-byte dump of the entire memory image.
      </p>
    </behavior>
   
    <behavior name="image mmap">
      <p>
      As an alternative to the batch image load/store function, when
      the <pin>image-mmap</pin> pin is driven, the component will map
      into memory the first <attribute>size</attribute> bytes of
      <attribute>image-file</attribute>.  It is mapped in
      <tt>MAP_SHARED</tt>, <tt>PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE</tt> mode.
      Additionally, when the <pin>image-msync</pin> pin is driven, the
      msync system call is invoked to force a synchronization between
      the physical file and the memory image.
      </p>

      <p>
      The file will be unmapped when the component is deleted, or when
      the <attribute>size</attribute> attribute is written to.  State
      save/restore stores the content of the mapped memory buffer, not
      the mapped-ness.
      </p>
    </behavior>

    <behavior name="error indication">
      <p>
      When operating system errors prevent some configuration-related
      action from succeeding, the <pin>error</pin> output pin is
      driven.  Reasons may include attempting to access nonexistent
      files, out-of-memory conditions, permission problems, and so on.
      It is advantageous to configure the connection from this pin to
      some system-wide recepient before failure-prone component
      configuration occurs.
      </p>
    </behavior>

    <behavior name="memory latency">
      <p>
      The component models the effects of memory latency.  The
      <attribute>read-latency</attribute> and
      <attribute>write-latency</attribute> values specify the
      latencies for memory reads and writes, respectively.
      </p>
    </behavior>

    <behavior name="reading/writing">
      <p>
      When an access is received on either the
      <bus>read-only-port</bus> or <bus>read-write-port</bus> bus, the
      component checks the incoming address.  If it is an in-range
      read access, it will be carried out.  If it is a write access,
      it will be prevented through the <bus>read-only-port</bus>.
      </p>

      <p>
      There are no restrictions on access alignment or size imposed by
      this model.
      </p>
    </behavior>

    <convention name="functional" supported="true"/>
    <convention name="latency" supported="true">
      The component models memory latency.
    </convention>
    <convention name="save/restore" supported="true">
      The component supports saving and restoring state in addition to
      memory persistence, via the image-store pin/attribute.

    <p>
      It is most likely that this component will be used as the main
      memory for a CPU and connected through a mapper component such
      as hw-mapper-basic.
    </p>

    <p>
    A configuration file fragment appears below:
    </p>
    <code>
	new hw-mapper-basic bus
	new hw-cpu-arm7t cpu
	new hw-memory-ram/rom-basic mem
	# error indication
	connect-pin mem error -> main stop!
	set mem size 65536
	connect-bus cpu insn-memory bus access-port
	connect-bus cpu data-memory bus access-port
	connect bus [0-65535] mem read-write-port
	# a read-only shadow in high memory
	connect-bus [400000,465535] mem read-only-port
    </code>

    <title>Host system</title>
    
    <p>
    The memory is modelled as a contiguous array of bytes in host
    memory.  As such, a component configured for 8MB of memory
    requires 8MB of host memory.  This is an important consideration
    for simulations running on machines with low memory or on busy
    multiuser systems.  Similarly, when a memory image is written to
    disk, the same amount of space may be used there.</p>

    <p>
    When using memory mapped files, the host's virtual memory system
    may reduce physical RAM requirements considerably.
