* Synopsis
  This is a simulated AMD Am29 series flash memory. It can be
  configured to emulate any of the Am29 family members.

  Buses: read-write-port
  Pins: image-load image-store
  Attributes: device-code image-file manufacturer-code mode sector-size size size-max

  Library: libmemory.la
  Symbol name: mem_component_library

* Functionality

  - Modelling

  * Memory operations such as programming and erasing are achieved
    instantly in simulation.  As such, device facilities for
    performing in-progress operations such as suspending and resuming
    erase operations are not implemented.

  * Hardware sector protection is not implemented.

  - Behaviors

    * Configuration

      Flash memory chips are self-describing using their device-code
      and manufacturer-code values, accessible both to a target
      program, and to the simulator user via attributes.  Since a
      target program may infer memory size from these values, further
      simulation configuration that overrides these values should be
      avoided unless necessary.

      The "device-code" attribute represents the device code of the
      flash memory part being simulated.  Refer to the AMD data sheet
      for a complete list of device identification codes.  The
      "manufacturer-code" read-only attribute represents the
      manufacturer code of the flash memory.  It is a constant value
      for AMD.  The "sector-size" attribute specifies the size of an
      individual sector in the flash memory.  Typical values are 16
      and 64 Kbytes.

      When the "size" attribute is written-to with a legal value, a
      new cleared byte array is allocated with the new size.  The old
      byte array is thrown away.  The "size-max" read-only attribute
      supplies to the user the maximum size that this component will
      attempt to allocate.

    * Image save/load

      When the "image-load" pin is driven, this component will open
      and attempt to load the contents of the file given by the
      "image-file" attribute into the memory image.  The file is
      copied byte-for-byte.  If the file is too short, zeroes are used
      to fill out the rest of the memory.
 
      Similarly, when the "image-store" pin is driven, the component
      will write to the "image-file" file a byte-for-byte dump of the
      entire memory image.

    * Reading/writing

      When an access is received on the "read-write-port" bus, the
      component checks the incoming address and rejects it if
      out-of-range. The component also rejects non-byte-sized accesses.

      Memory can be read at will, but AMD's protocol must be followed
      to put the device into byte program mode or unlock bypass mode.
      The "mode" read-only attribute reveals the internal state of the
      device state machine.  This is primarily designed for testing
      purposes.

  - SID conventions

    * This is a functional component.
    * The component supports saving and restoring state in addition to
      memory persistence, via the image-store pin/attribute.
    * Triggerpoints are not supported.

* Environment

 - Related components

    * Customized versions of this component are available for standard
      members of the Am29 flash family.  Instantiating each of them is
      equivalent to instantiating this generic component and adding
      the matching "sector-size", "size", and "device-code" attribute
      settings.

    * A flash memory will usually form a small part of the complete
      memory subsystem, providing a region of non-volatile memory. The 
      following configuration file fragment demonstrates this:

	new hw-mapper-basic bus
	new hw-memory-flash-am29lv010b flash # AM29LV010B: 128KB size, 16K sectors-size
	connect-bus bus [0,0x1FFFF] flash read-write-port

  - Host system

  * The memory is modelled as a contiguous array of bytes in host
    memory.  As such, a component configured for 8MB of memory
    requires 8MB of host memory.  This is an important consideration
    for simulations running on machines with low memory or on busy
    multiuser systems.  Similarly, when a memory image is written to
    disk, the same amount of space may be used there.
