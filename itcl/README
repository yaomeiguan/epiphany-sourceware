		   - Sourceware.org Incr Tcl Overview -
			Written by Keith Seitz

This module is an import of the ITcl/Itk/Iwidgets modules for Tcl/Tk
into the sourceware.org repository. The net sources have been
imported into the NET branch and subsequently merged into the
main repository branch (HEAD or tip or what have you).

All three modules are distributed separately, and have been committed
to the vendor branch using the following layout:

itcl/
  itcl/  itk/  iwidgets/

The itcl, itk, and iwidgets subfolders contain the virgin upstream
sources from sf.net. Configury has been added in the toplevel itcl/
folder to set facilitate building Itcl et al as part of a sourceware.org
build.

To import a new version of Incr Tcl, follow this procedure:

1. Download the itcl, itk, and iwidgets source tarballs. And
   layout the sources in the following hierarchy: itcl/, itcl/itcl, itcl/itk,
   and itcl/iwidgets. The toplevel itcl folder should only contain three
   subfolders -- no regular files.
2. Checkout the itcl module:
  $ cvs co naked-itcl
3. Force a commit for every file:
  $ cd src/itcl
  $ cvs commit -f -R -m "touch all sources to ease next import"
4. Import the new sources:
  $ cd /my/local/itcl
  $ cvs import -ko -I\! -m 'imported Itcl 3.3' src/itcl NET ITCL_3_3
5. Merge local changes with the newly imported sources:
  $ cd /some/empty/directory
  $ cvs co -jNET:yesterday -jNET src/itcl
  ... look at merges; resolve any conflicts ...
  $ cvs commit
6. Update working directory. This step is often done in parallel
   with merging and conflict resolution.
7. I also go back and remove obsolete files from the NET branch
   (files which no longer exist).

While I have attempted to add only toplevel configury for Itcl,
it has been necessary to directly fiddle with the sources, particularly
for iwidgets, whose build configury I have updated to mimmick that
of itcl and itk. I have also regenerated autotools files. Check the toplevel
ChangeLog for specifics when merging. I have only added *local* differences
between the NET branch and the HEAD/tip version into the ChangeLog.

I have opted not to add "SOURCEWARE LOCAL" around everything. They never
really seem to help me anyway. It is much easier to inspect diffs of
the vendor branch and the main repository copy.
