/* These functions manage a set of LWPs that you can wait for for á là
   waitpid, but that you can also stop and continue as a group without
   disturbing individual threads' wait statuses.

   Here we use "LWP" to mean the kernel-level thingy that is running
   code, and "thread" to mean the POSIX threads / libthread_db-level
   object.  The Linux kernel calls an 'LWP' a 'thread', which would be
   confusing.

   The LWPs must be either children of the calling process, or
   processes we have attached to --- something we will hear about when
   we call 'waitpid'.

   We have separate tables for Unix LWP's and libthread_db threads,
   because even though standard Linux distributions have never used
   M:N threads, there still isn't a simple 1:1 relationship between
   them.  Before the thread library has been loaded and initialized
   itself, you have an LWP with no thread.  After a thread has exited,
   but before any other thread has joined with it, you can have a
   thread with no LWP.  Add that to the way libthread_db reports the
   id of an exited LWP as being equal to ps_getpid (proc_handle), and
   it becomes worthwhile having a clear separation between the two.  */


/* Add PID to the LWP pool, assuming that PID is stopped, and the

   PID is already in the pool, do nothing and return 0.  If PID was
   not already in the pool and we successfully attached to it, return
   1.  On failure, return -1 and set errno.

   If there is an interesting wait status available for PID,
   lwp_pool_waitpid will report it, but the wait status caused by the
   attach is handled internally, and will not be reported via
   lwp_pool_waitpid.  */

   lwp_pool_stop_all, etc.

   PID must be either -1 (wait for any process) or a positive
   integer (wait for the process with that specific pid).

   The only bit that may be set in OPTIONS is WNOHANG.  We need to
   monitor the status of all LWP's, so we add __WALL as appropriate.  */
